This is Version 1 of my Handwritten Digit Recognition system using ANN.
ANN performs well on simple test data but may sometimes give incorrect predictions for real handwritten digits.
In future updates, I will improve this project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for higher accuracy.

# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognizer - ANN
This is a Streamlit app where users can draw digits (0–9) and the model predicts the digit using a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on MNIST dataset.
### 🧠 Model
- Trained on MNIST dataset
- Input: 28x28 grayscale image
- Output: Digit (0–9)

### ✅ Features
- Draw your own digit
- Real-time prediction
- Confidence score displayed
